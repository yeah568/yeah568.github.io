            <h1>Rainbow Dash is Best Pony</h1>
            <h2>April 17, 2015 - 6 min read</h2>
            <h4><em>I overanalyze a children's cartoon in order to show that my choice of favourite character is justified.</em></h4>
        </div>
        <p>I’ve held as a firm belief that Rainbow Dash is best pony ever since I started out in the fandom in the summer of 2011. Sure, you have tons of people saying she’s immature, self-absorbed, generally terrible - not completely untrue, definitely, but she has quite a number of redeeming traits. Thanks to Castle Sweet Castle (for those of you who can’t remember episode names like me, it’s the one where they all mess up Twilight’s giant tree castle thing by throwing things around in a desperate attempt to decorate it), we have a great example of why Rainbow Dash is best pony (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLWq2d21lVQ&amp;t=5" target="_blank">and fully deserves her own show</a>).</p>

<p>The scene where the Mane 6 (minus Twilight) decorate the castle is where I’m going to be focusing on with this post.
The entire thing is done in a rather excellent song, which means it’s over rather quickly, but we can still figure out a few things simply by looking at what they choose to bring to the castle.</p>

<p>Before I start, however, I’d just like to take a moment to point out the fact that evidently, these horses have learned <em>nothing at all</em>. In Suited For Success, they all impose their own preferences and desires over top of Rarity’s area of expertise, which they then realize was a terrible mistake and should have just let Rarity do her thing. Now, sure, that’s not <em>exactly</em> what their letter to the Princess said, but roll with me here. The same thing happens in this episode - they each impose their own vision onto the castle, failing to recognize the fact that they should probably pick things that the person who’s actually going to be living there might enjoy. All this friendship stuff must be a real pain to remember.</p>

<p class="img-right" title="Flowers do not grow that quickly. AJ CONFIRMED FOR MAGIC EARTH HORSE THING."><img src="/assets/img/posts/rd/aj_dirt.png" alt="AJ dumps dirt in the castle." />
As we all know, dirt is vital to keeping your home clean and tidy.</p>

<p>But I digress! Back to overanalysis. First off, we have Applejack. She heads back to the farm to grab some apples and hay - fair enough, who doesn’t like apples and hay? Horrible, horrible folks, that’s for sure. The thing is though, with perishables like apples, if you give them some time, they rot. Decompose. Turn into mush. Considering these were meant to decorate the castle permanently (or at least some reasonably long period of time), they’d quickly go bad and need replacing. I don’t know about AJ, but I feel like giving your family’s main product away every two weeks for free, just to have them go bad isn’t a great business model.</p>

<p>Later on in the song, she throws various gardening supplies onto her corner of the room, which would be a great housewarming gift, <em>if</em> there were a garden for her to use them in. Judging by <a href="http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Friendship_Rainbow_Kingdom_castle" target="_blank">pictures of the castle</a>, there’s merely large rolling hills of grass around the castle. Besides, if she were to dig any of it up, Twilight would probably have to deal with the Homeowner’s Association, and that’s a can of worms nobody wants to get into.</p>

<p>I’m not even going to get into the dirt thing. That one speaks for itself.</p>

<p>Fluttershy’s got good intentions when she brings a bunch of animals - it’s to help keep Twilight company! It would’ve been fantastic, if only she <em>already isn’t alone</em>. Spike is by her side nearly 24/7, not to mention <a href="https://regex101.com/r/tH6yZ0/2" target="_blank">/Owl(o(w|y))?i?s?c?io?us/</a> is already her pet. In addition, Fluttershy is the one who says the single worst sentence in a song from the show (except maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzsxfO7dBlA&amp;t=44" target="_blank">“I could care less” by Chrysalis/Cadance</a>) - “to show that we have shown”. What does that even mean?! Do they really have to explicitly point out the fact to Twilight that they’ve shown her what a castle can become?</p>

<p class="img-left" title="[suggestive plate-looking intensifies]"><img src="/assets/img/posts/rd/pinkie_party_cannon.png" alt="Pinkie looks for a party cannon. Underneath cupcakes." />
Introducing the new Party Cannon® Nano™.</p>

<p>Pinkie doesn’t even try to be creative this time around, and just brings party supplies and hides a bunch of party cannons. Speaking of which, how many of those does she have? She mentions way back when how she “never leaves home without [her] party cannon”, implying she only has the one. Now, she has so many that she can afford to hide them everywhere, not to mention the fact that they’re so tiny that she’s literally looking for them underneath a pile of cupcakes. Clearly, she’s done some massive improvements on the party cannon design, and has started mass producing them, it’s the only realistic option. Now, I’m not saying that mass produced party cannons are a <em>bad</em> thing, but to use them to spruce up a new home? Well, I’ll just say that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq7Eki5EZ8o" target="_blank">Weird Al might have some opinions on that…</a></p>

<p>Even though Rainbow Dash shows up next in the song, I’ll skip over her for now and come back to her later, which means it’s time to pick apart Rarity’s contributions. She actually brings some useful things - curtains! Certainly, time and effort went into these (which would probably put her second in my ranking if it were entirely based on this song), but sewing things is essentially her entire job. If she can make a bunch of dresses for free for all six of them, then a couple curtains certainly isn’t a big deal.</p>

<p>Finally, we reach the crux of the article - why Rainbow Dash has proved herself to be the best out of the lot. She heads back to her home to grab posters, trophies, figures, all sorts of Wonderbolts memorabilia. Now, you may be wondering, “Why does that make her better? That’s just various knick-knacks she found in her house!’, which is true. The thing to note here though, is that these things have true meaning to RD. She worked hard to earn those trophies, she’s collected posters of her personal heroes, and that Spitfire <s>Amiibo</s> figurine is on a special, reserved space on her bookshelf, clearly it’s special to her. She gave up her own prized possessions so that Twilight would feel comfortable in her own home. The others simply brought generic items with no real meaning, at least RD was <em>sort of</em> right the first time around.</p>

<p class="img-center" title="Give it ten years, and that figure will probably be worth some decent cash on eNay."><img src="/assets/img/posts/rd/rd_amiibo.png" alt="Rainbow Dash is adorable." />
Rainbow Dash literally puts Spitfire on a pedestal.</p>

<p>Now, as you’ve undoubtedly realized by this point, I’ve shown without a doubt that Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie and Rarity are all terrible friends and Rainbow Dash is literally the best. She’s the one who put some thought into her decorations, without needing a group epiphany. Is she perfect? Certainly not, but she’s always been a loyal friend, who, despite her (occasionally justified) arrogance, has always had her friends’ best interests at heart. That, for me, is enough to place her right at the top of my list.</p>

<p>PS. Rainbow Dash needs more songs. Ashleigh Ball does an amazing job with her.</p>

<p>PPS. Please don’t take this post super seriously! I wrote this for fun, as a distraction from studying for finals, and as an excuse to finish setting up my blog.</p>

<p>PPPS. That being said, Rainbow Dash is actually best pony. <em style="font-size: 0;">[](/b31 Not that I’m biased or anything.)</em></p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> horse</p>
