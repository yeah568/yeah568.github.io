Entering its second year of operation at the University of British Columbia, the UBC eSports Association needed volunteers to help create promotional material for the club. Snoopeh, a professional League of Legends player, visited the university and held a meet and greet. I was responsible for editing the footage together and creating a video of the event for the club, from footage that was mostly shot on point and shoot cameras.
