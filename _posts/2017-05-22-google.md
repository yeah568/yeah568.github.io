During the summer of 2017, I interned on the FirebasePerformance Monitoring team at Google. I implemented a new, patented, interactive chart design for showing distribution densities, calculated from existing quantile-based data.
I also Worked closely with designers and statisticians to ensure the charts were statistically accurate, while maintaining a quality user experience.

Worked extensively with AngularJS, D3, and several proprietary Google engineering tools.
