For the summer of 2016, I participated in the Microsoft Garage Internship Vancouver, an intensive 4 month session focused on building new and innovative software, in teams composed entirely of interns. 

My team worked on two projects over the course of the four months. The first half of the internship had our team working on desktop PowerPoint. We worked closely with the Office team to implement a brand new feature, with a backend server running on Azure, and a companion web interface.

My primary role was on the real-time backend service, which was built with Node.js, and provides Socket.IO and SOAP endpoints for clients to connect. Additionally, I wrote the companion consumer-facing web app to interact with the native component, which was written in Angular 2.

The remainder of the summer was focused on developing an Android app that encourages Vancouverites to discover, connect, and explore the city through public art. Produced in partnership with the City of Vancouver, 

As part of the grand opening ceremonies of the Microsoft Vancouver office, Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson, British Columbia Premier Christy Clark, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited and toured the office, and the initial prototype for the app was demoed to them as a demonstration of both the agility of Microsoft as an organization, and the power that comes from being able to work as a private organization in partnership with a public entity.

I was responsible for implementing the geolocation and capture verification,  bringing much of the app up to the design spec, handling and requesting permissions on Android 6.0 and above, and implementing the data access layer for parts of the database.
