Developed over the course of a few days in the summer of 2014, Confinder is a simple client-side Angular application that lets you find conventions near you.

Based on AngularJS, Confinder utilizes the HTML5 Geolocation API (with a Google Maps based geocoder as a fallback) to calculate the distance between you and a wide variety of cons. Convention data is stored in a simple JSON file, and is served to and rendered on the client.
