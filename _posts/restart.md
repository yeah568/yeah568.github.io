(Currently trying to find some screenshots of the site, bear with me!)

Developed and maintained a site built with WordPress and the webcomic publishing theme ComicPress. Run with a team of four others from across the United States, this weekly webcomic amassed over 125 thousand pageviews. I was also in charge of editing the weekly podcast, and writing an opinion article once a week. Nominated for a spot on Kotaku's weekly webcomic feature, Sunday Comics.
