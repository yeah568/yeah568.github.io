The Greater Vancouver Society of Students for Accelerated Integration is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping new immigrants in Metro Vancouver integrate and acclimate to their new homes. As the Head Media Developer, I created the site (unfortunately, currently down), and helped to create promotional material for the organization.
