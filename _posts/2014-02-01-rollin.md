A simple, powerful dice roller. No fluff, no mess, just dice.

Perfect for RPG players, people playing board games on a moving vehicle where it's inconvenient to roll physical dice, and anyone needing something to be decided by chance. (You may be able to tell, I'm amazing at determining use cases.)

Developed for the Microsoft Developer Movement, the app was made in early 2014, and represents my first app for Windows Phone.
