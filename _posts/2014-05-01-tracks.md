In May of 2014, I helped to create a video for the Launch Academy Student Startup Challenge with my friends William and Shikib. The idea is simple - an app that lets you race your friends, whether that's running, biking, skateboarding, rollerblading, or any other form of transportation you can imagine. You can either race in real time, with friends around the world based on distance, or create "tracks", a circuit that you can record, and your friends can then compete with a "ghost" of you. Additionally, OnTrack provides on-demand advice on routines and training catered to you.

The video was created over approximately two weeks, using the Adobe Creative Suite (Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and After Effects). I created the logo and branding, general design, motion graphics, and edited the video. Overall, we placed 7th in the competition.
